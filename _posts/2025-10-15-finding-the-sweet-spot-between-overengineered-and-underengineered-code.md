There’s a moment in every developer’s career when you realize: both too little and too much engineering hurt the project just the same — only in different ways.

You start with a simple idea. A few lines of code, a working prototype, a green checkmark in CI.

Then, a few weeks later, someone adds a new feature. Suddenly, that “temporary” solution you wrote on a Friday evening becomes a critical dependency.
And it starts to fall apart.

So you swing the pendulum the other way. You introduce layers, abstractions, interfaces, dependency injection, test coverage. The code is now future-proof — or so you think. But no one else understands it.

You’ve built a fortress where a cabin would have done.

Welcome to the never-ending dance between underengineering and overengineering.
