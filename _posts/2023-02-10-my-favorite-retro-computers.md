I started collecting my retro computers somehow by accident. My first game console was the **Pegasus IQ-502** which I got from my parents around 1994. The console was technically a Nintendo Entertainment System clone produced by the Taiwanese company called Micro Genius, and was very popular in the early 90s in Poland, before the anti-piracy law was introduced to the Polish legal system.

The main chip of the unit was the UA6527P which was a DIL-40 CPU clocked at 1.77 MHz. It was a copy of the Ricoh RP2A03 used in the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom) and the RP2A07 in the NES console (PAL) using the MOS 6502.

The video and sound capabilities were very limited in this 8-bit system, but in contrast to systems like MSX it has a smooth vertical scrolling used in many platform games.

My first personal computer was **Atari 800XL** which I got from my uncle as my cousins were already on Commodore Amiga 500, so the old 8-bit machine was just gathering dust. I had no software so I had to write my own programs to have any fun from it. The Atari 800XL is a continuation of designed in 1979 Atari 8-bit systems and uses the same CPU, but has much more RAM, 64 KB. I could use a tape recorder to persist my own programs, which was super handy compared to Pegasus which used only read-only cartridges.

When I got my first PC around 2001, I packed everything and put it in the attic, so then I found it back years later, around 2018 after approximately 17 years! My Atari works fine to this very day, and sometimes I plug it to my modern TV via some sort of video converter or to the HDMI monitor via my old Pioneer DVD Recorder. In 2020, I did a general cleaning of the inside of the computer with IPA alcohol.

![Commodore 64]({{site.url}}/assets/2023-02-10/Commodore64.jpg)

The **Commodore 64** is a completely new buy. I haven't owned any Commodore computer back then in the 90s and I didn't even see back then, but I have heard many stories from some of my friends that had seen this computer in action. I was always impressed by the number of available software and games for this system. My C64 is usually referred as the C64-C and it's a newer revision from the early 90s but fully compatible with the old "bread bin" Commodore 64 from 1982. Its motherboard was a bit rearranged and made shorter (e.g. less RAM chips as a single piece could contain more memory), and the SID audio chip has been improved.

I love the sound of the SID chip. It has 3 voices which can independently generate one of 4 types of waves: sawtooth, triangle, rectangle, and white noise. It utilizes a coupe of analog filters so every SID sounds a bit differently.

To load programs I use two independent devices:
- **Tapecart** which emulates a tape dataset,
- **SD2IEC** which emulates the IEC device. It's not fully compatible with the Commodore disk drive but many D64 images of C64 disks work just fine, or have been patched.

You can find the footage of me playing some C64 games below (I used my Pioneer DVR-645 to capture it).

![Nintendo DSi]({{site.url}}/assets/2023-02-10/Nintendo_DSi.jpg)

The **Nintendo DSi** is as well a totally new buy. I bought it very cheap and in very good condition. The only Nintendo handheld I knew from my childhood was the GameBoy. But back then no one from my school had it and we used some sort of PC emulators to play Pokemon Gold, but I have never used any real hardware to play these games. DSi can easily emulate GameBoy and obviously can run games dedicated for the platform. All Nintendo DS devices combined hit the impressive sales level of over 150 millions of sold devices.

![NES Cartridges]({{site.url}}/assets/2023-02-10/NES_Carts.jpg)

Maybe my collection of Famicom cartridges is not super huge but I collected almost all my favorite games I played as a kid. Unfortunately I don't have my original cartridges I owned as a kid, so I had to buy them again. My favorite games are definitely: Super Mario Bros. (The very first game I ever played on a game console!), Tiny Toon Adventures (This game was on my very first cartridge bought with my mom). I have also a few Chinese "reproductions" from AliExpress which are a bit more similar to what we could buy in Polish stores in the early 90s. 

![Raspberry Pi]({{site.url}}/assets/2023-02-10/Raspberry_Pi.jpg)

The last but for sure not least is my Raspberry Pi 3 model B+. This is not a retro computer (if you look closer, the board is from 2017), but I use it to emulate a number of different retro systems like: NES (Pegasus runs games a bit slower than the original system), SNES, Sega Genesis, PC Engine, Atari VCS.

I am very sentimental about these old computers. Since I still have some room for them I won't give them away for now, but I definitely won't extend my collection anytime soon. ðŸ˜„
