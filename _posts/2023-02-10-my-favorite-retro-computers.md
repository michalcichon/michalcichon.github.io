I started collecting my retro computers somehow by accident. My first game console was the **Pegasus IQ-502** which I got from my parents around 1994. The console was technically a Nintendo Entertainment System clone produced by the Taiwanese company called Micro Genius, and was very popular in the early 90s in Poland, before the anti-piracy law was introduced to the Polish legal system.

The main chip of the unit was the UA6527P which was a DIL-40 CPU clocked at 1.77 MHz. It was a copy of the Ricoh RP2A03 used in the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom) and the RP2A07 in the NES console (PAL) using the MOS 6502.

My first personal computer was Atari 800XL which I got from my uncle as my cousins were already on Commodore Amiga 500, so the old 8-bit machine was just gathering dust. I had no software so I had to write my own programs to have any fun from it. The Atari 800XL is a continuation of designed in 1979 Atari 8-bit systems and uses the same CPU, but has a lot more of RAM, 64 KB. I could use a tape recorder to persist my own programs, which was super handy comparing with Pegasus which used only read-only cartridges.

When I got my first PC, I packed everything and put it in the attic, so then I found it back years later, around 2018. My Atari works fine to this very day, and sometimes I plug it to my modern TV via some sort of video converter or to the HDMI monitor via my old Pioneer DVD Recorder.

The Commodore 64 is a completely new buy. I haven't owned any Commodore back then in 90s and I didn't even see it in 90s, but I heard many stories that some of my friends saw this computer in action. I was always impressed by the number of available software and games on this system. My C64 is called C64-C and it's a newer version from the early 90s but fully compatible with "bread bin" Commodore 64 from 1982. Its motherboard was a bit rearranged and made shorter (e.g. less RAM chips as a single piece could contain more memory), and the SID audio chip has been improved.
