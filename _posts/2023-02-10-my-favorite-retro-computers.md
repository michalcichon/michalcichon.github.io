I started collecting my retro computers somehow by accident. My first game console was the **Pegasus IQ-502** which I got from my parents around 1994. The console was technically a Nintendo Entertainment System clone produced by the Taiwanese company Micro Genius, and was very popular in the early 90s in Poland, before the anti-piracy law was introduced to the Polish legal system.

The main chip of the unit was the UA6527P which was a DIL-40 CPU clocked at 1.77 MHz. It was a copy of the Ricoh RP2A03 used in the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom) and the RP2A07 in the NES console (PAL) using the MOS 6502.

The video and sound capabilities of this 8-bit system were a bit limited, but unlike systems like the MSX, it had smooth vertical scrolling, which was used in many platform games.

My first personal computer was the **Atari 800XL**, which I got from my uncle because my cousins were already on the Commodore Amiga 500, so the old 8-bit machine was just gathering dust. I had no software, so I had to write my own programs to get any enjoyment out of them. The Atari 800XL is a continuation of Atari 8-bit systems designed in 1979 and uses the same CPU but has much more RAM, 64 KB. I could use a tape recorder to persist my own programs, which was super handy compared to the Pegasus, which used only read-only cartridges.

When I got my first PC around 2001, I packed everything and put it in the attic, so I found it back years later, around 2018, after approximately 17 years! My Atari works fine to this very day, and sometimes I connect it to my modern TV via some sort of video converter or to the HDMI monitor via my old Pioneer DVD Recorder. In 2020, I did a general cleaning of the inside of the computer with IPA alcohol.

![Commodore 64]({{site.url}}/assets/2023-02-10/Commodore64.jpg)

The **Commodore 64** is a brand-new purchase. Although I didn't have a Commodore computer in the 1990s and I never even saw one in person, I had heard many tales from people who had. The variety of apps and games that were readily available for this system always astounded me. My C64, also known as the C64-C, is a later model from the early 1990s that is still fully compatible with the original "bread bin" Commodore 64 from 1982. The SID audio chip has been upgraded, and the motherboard has been slightly reconfigured and condensed (fewer RAM chips are used because a single component can hold more memory).

I love the sound of the SID chip.  It features three voices, each of which may produce one of the four wave types: sawtooth, triangle, rectangle, and white noise. Because it makes use of several analog filters, each SID has a somewhat different sound.

I utilize two separate devices to load programs: **Tapecart**, which emulates a tape dataset, and **SD2IEC**, which emulates an IEC device. The Commodore disk drive isn't entirely compatible with it, however many D64 images of C64 disks are fully functional or have been patched.

You can find the footage of me playing some C64 games below (I used my Pioneer DVR-645 to capture it).

![Nintendo DSi]({{site.url}}/assets/2023-02-10/Nintendo_DSi.jpg)

The **Nintendo DSi** is also a totally new buy. I bought it very cheaply and in very good condition. The only Nintendo handheld I knew from my childhood was the GameBoy. But back then, no one from my school had it, and we used some sort of PC emulator to play Pokemon Gold, but I have never used any real hardware to play these games. DSi can easily emulate GameBoy and can run games dedicated to the platform. The total number of sold Nintendo DS devices reached an impressive 150 million.

![NES Cartridges]({{site.url}}/assets/2023-02-10/NES_Carts.jpg)

Maybe my collection of Famicom cartridges is not super huge, but I collected almost all my favorite games I played as a kid. Unfortunately, I don't have the original cartridges I owned as a kid, so I had to buy them again. My favorite games are unquestionably Super Mario Bros. (the first game I ever played on a game console!) and Tiny Toon Adventures (which was on my very first cartridge purchased with my mom). I have a few Chinese "reproductions" from AliExpress that are a bit more similar to what we could buy in Polish stores in the early 90s.

![Raspberry Pi]({{site.url}}/assets/2023-02-10/Raspberry_Pi.jpg)

The last but for sure not least, is my Raspberry Pi 3 model B+. This is not a retro computer (if you look closer, the board is from 2017), but I use it to emulate a number of different retro systems like: NES (the Pegasus runs games a bit slower than the original system), SNES, Sega Genesis, PC Engine, and Atari VCS.

I am very sentimental about these old computers. Since I still have some room for them, I won't give them away for now, but I definitely won't extend my collection anytime soon. ðŸ˜„
