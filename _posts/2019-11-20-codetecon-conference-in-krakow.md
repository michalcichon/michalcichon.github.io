On November 15th I had a great opportunity to attend the 5th edition of CodeteCON.

It is a technology conference dedicated to an IT community frequently organized in Krakow and Lublin. This time we had three tracks: Data Science, Front-end & Back-end, open lightning talks scene and a Friday After party! 

I am happy that my company organizes such a great tech event. That was a great opportunity to share knowledge and meet people from the industry.
