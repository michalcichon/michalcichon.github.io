Coding without actually writing any code sounds tempting — especially for those who don’t know how to code. It also seems like a nice approach to prototyping when we’re not familiar or proficient with a given technology but need quick results.

This time, I wanted to test the capabilities of three popular LLMs: ChatGPT 5, Claude (Sonnet 4.5), and Gemini (2.5 Pro). The task was simple: to code a basic memory game that everyone is familiar with. The rule was straightforward — I would only describe what I expected and point out any issues I noticed, but I wouldn’t touch the code itself at all. Let’s see which LLM performs better.
