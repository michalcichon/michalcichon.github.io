Sometimes we need a tunnel to pass our internet traffic trough some external server. We usually do that when we have some limitations from our internet provider and want to enter pages we normally don't have access to. In this short tutorial I will show you how to do that using **PuTTY** (SSH) and **Google Chrome**.

## Requirements

We will need a shell account obviously. There are plenty of providers, and universities usually give sort of shell accounts to their students. Chrome browser can be downloaded [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and PuTTY can be found [here](https://www.putty.org/).

## Creating SSH Tunnel in PuTTY

First thing we need to do is creating connection. Open PuTTY and configure your connection by providing host address and port number. For SSH we usually use port `22`.

![Step 1]({{site.url}}/assets/2014-03-20/tunnel-1.jpg)

Go to *Connection â†’ SSH â†’ Tunnels* option in the tree view (left panel).

![Step 2]({{site.url}}/assets/2014-03-20/tunnel-7.png)

Now we need to do as follows: choose *Dynamic*, fill in the source port (for example `9999`, but feel free to use any available port) and click *Add* button. Now it should be something in format `D{PORT_NUMBER}` on the list above. Click on **Open**.

Next, log in to your server as usual:

Since now we have our own proxy server on *127.0.0.1:9999*.

## Using a tunnel in Google Chrome

It's the time for the crucial part of the configuration. ðŸ˜› We need to configure proxy in Chrome. It is not so intuitive because when we want to set it in Chrome by Chrome's setting, it redirects us to Control Panel with Networking configuration opened. We don't want to change the configuration of the whole PC but only for Chrome browser so we need to do this other way.

In Firefox we have a nice configuration manager where we can choose proxy server for Firefox exclusively but there is no such thing in Chrome. The solution is to use parameters when we start the browser. We could provide them by the command prompt from the Chrome location:

```
chrome.exe --proxy-server="socks5://127.0.0.1:9999"
```

But using Windows **shortcuts** is much easier. Just copy your Chrome shortcut to Desktop and change its name to something like *Chrome - tunneled* to identify it easier. Then right click on it and choose `Properties` from the menu  (`WÅ‚aÅ›ciwoÅ›ci` on the screenshot).

![Step 4]({{site.url}}/assets/2014-03-20/tunnel-5.png)

Now provide parameters in the Setting window as in the screenshot below. 

![Step 5]({{site.url}}/assets/2014-03-20/tunnel-6.png)

In the `Target` ("Element docelowy" on the screenshot) field we add `proxy-server` parameter. We don't change the existing text but we add the text below just after `chrome.exe"`:

```
--proxy-server="socks5://127.0.0.1:9999
```

Now you can click on the **OK** button.

Make sure you have provided the correct port number. I used `9999` and you can use whatever you want but it is important to use the same in the PuTTY's and Chrome's configurations.
