I have my own **App Store Connect** account since 2016 but I used to use it as my playground and testing environment. Sometimes I used this account to prepare test builds for my clients, but most of the time it was quite empty and abandoned. Now I decided to change it so I started to work on some side projects this year. One of them is Dice.

**The simplest app on the Earth**

In the first iteration I wanted to keep the design of the app as simple as posible. It has only a toggle to choose single or double dice mode. I wanted to avoid designing complex UI for choosing between variaty of different configurations, die types, rules etc. It should be **as simple as a die itself**.

My goals could be listed as follows:
- Make the UX as simple as possible
- Clear and colorful UI
- Continuous experience: **toggle state should be persisted**, so if someone kills the app or something unexpected happens it should start as it was before
- Available in more than **6 languages** (especially in English, Polish, Slovak, Ukrainian, Czech and Russian)
- Keep it easy to extend: it should be **easy to add new functionalities** etc.
- Persist as many statistics as possible to reuse them in the next iterations
- Nice architecture: the app is simple and was developed in hours (not days, weeks or months) but I wanted to do this right anyways (BTW I chose the MVVM... And ehm, it has no so many models actually... ðŸ˜…)
- 100% Swift

You can find **Dice: shake and roll** on the App Store.
