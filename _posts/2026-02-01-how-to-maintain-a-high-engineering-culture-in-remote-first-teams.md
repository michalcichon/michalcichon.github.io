**Working remotely in a distributed team has many benefits. We can meet people from different countries and cultures, learn about their customs, and view many aspects of life from a different perspective. On the other hand, it removes the illusion of productivity. It exposes every weakness in communication, ownership, and trust.**

## Knowing your team

This may sound obvious, yet it’s worth checking, as doing it properly can be a game changer. Don’t assume you know someone until you really get to know them. It’s much easier to work with someone after spending a few minutes on a casual call—it reduces the cognitive load required to communicate with someone we barely know.

Understanding our position within the organization is just as important. Knowing whom to contact when we’re stuck, who is less experienced and may need more check-ins, and who our line manager is can make a big difference. Being clear about roles and responsibilities helps especially when we face bigger problems or need support in improving processes.

## Communication architecture

In a distributed team, keeping everyone in the loop is crucial. Psychological safety improves when people understand the team’s current focus and priorities. Starting each week with a short team sync to share goals helps align everyone around the main objective.

It really helps keep focus during the week. I once worked with a very charismatic CTO who spread positive energy that lasted all week.
