*I have been working as a contractor software developer for many years. In my job I have a lot of what I enjoy the most - crème de la crème called writing programs. This process is almost never a single shot of writing what was thought, run, test and commit. It is obviously not as there are always nuances of what should be done, any kind of limitations and as always expectations which can be changed dynamically.*

The process or building new logic in our programs is never a linear process as It has been already mentioned thousands times across articles, books and blog posts like this you are reading at the moment. Fortunately I don’t want to start this topic here again. This time I would like to talk about something slightly different but still not something that floats totally separated of that crème de la crème. This thing is evaluating someone else code. And what I mean here is not code review we do for our friendly coworkers we know inside out with all weird habits and ... This time I would like to step for a minute and think about evaluating code for candidates, people we never known or companies that need to evaluate the state of their software to decide if they should invest more into quality.

Nicklaus Wirth coined that title about relation of programs, algorithms and data structures in 1976. It was 45 years ago but such clever foundations like this will probably never get old. If you stop and think about it for a second it is obviously always true. Every design patters, every function, method and spaghetti code you just wrote to scrape some silly thing from the internet can be divided into two categories: data we manipulate and



<!-- 
- check git history 
- shared state/singleton why they are not good why they can be helpful (date formatter at Comarch) show how we can test shared state/singletons and what can’t be tested
- Global state
- Threads, queues
- Duplicated code
- Unused code
- Consistent naming (if he’s been working for a long time and built it info his muscles or not)
- Used data structures and algorithms (reinvenions, quality etc)
- Mobile specific: resources management, UI, SDKs etc
