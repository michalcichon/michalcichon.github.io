On my daily basis I use a lot of different tools which I believe boost my productivity. In this short article I would like to list them and give you a few words on why I choose to use them and how I benefit from using them.

# Zsh and Oh My Zsh

![Oh My Zsh]({{site.url}}/assets/2020-02-17/zsh.png)

[**Z shell (Zsh)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) is a nice replacement for the standard Bash shell. I like the way **Z shell** recursively expands and completes paths and variables, and how it deals with the spelling correction. This is a definitelly a huge boost when I use Terminal. I am not a power user of Unix nevertheless I feel the difference and there is [**Oh My Zsh**](https://ohmyz.sh) that helps configuring Zsh to make the overall experience even better. I highly recommend these tools.

**Zsh** is available by default on macOS and it is easy to change the default shell with the following command.

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

Installing **Oh My Zsh** is also easy and the one-line command used to fetch and run the instalation script is available on [their website](https://ohmyz.sh).

# iTerm, vim and aliases

Sometimes I need to modify files on a remote server. I use my own `.vim` configuration that I created by adjusting some example I found online. On mac I use [**iTerm2**](https://www.iterm2.com) which is, I believe, a nice replacement for the built-in macOS Terminal. It also gives some autocompletion features available by `âŒ˜+;` shortcut, themes etc.

As I abovementioned I'm not a unix power user so I utilize heavely on aliases. In my `.zshrc` you can find a lot of aliases like this one:

```sh
alias git-remove-issue-branches="git branch | grep \"issue/\" | xargs git branch -D"
alias git-remove-orig-files="find . -name '*.orig' -delete"
```

# SourceTree and kdiff3

I have been using [**SourceTree**](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) almost since its first release in 2013 when I used it to work with Mercurial repositories. Since I started using Git as it became more popular solution for distributed version control system, I have been still using SourceTree as my main tool for Git repositories.

[**kdiff3**](https://kdiff3.sourceforge.net) is with me for even longer time as I installed it for the first time on my computer at work 9 years ago. I love how it automatically resolves merge conflicts.

# RescueTime

![Example of RescueTime report]({{site.url}}/assets/2020-02-17/rescuetime.png)

[**RescueTime**](https://rescuetime.com) is a handy tool to keep focus ever day. I usually check my stats when I close my day so I can verify how much time I spend on real development work and I can decide if there is something to improve next day.

# feedly
