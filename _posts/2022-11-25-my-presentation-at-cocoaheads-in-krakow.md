Last week on Tuesday I had a great opportunity to present my own topic at the **CocoaHeads meetup** conference in Kraków.

That was the 40th edition of the meetup and this time it took place in the Brainly office in Zabłocie, Kraków. **CocoaHeads** is a recurring event organized by the iOS community for the iOS community. That's why it brings the most experienced and clever software developers working with iOS. 

My presentation was about Swift interoperability, from the most commonly used Objective-C to Swift, to the actively developed and promising features like C++ to Swift interoperability.

For me it was a totally new experience as I have never presented at an iOS conference before. And I'm looking forward for more events like this one. 

You can find my presentation and code samples on my [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3xosv54s4fakdg5/Swift%20interoperability%20%28Final%201.1%29.pdf?dl=0) and [GitHub](https://github.com/michalcichon/interoperability-examples) respectively. See you at the next conference! 😄
