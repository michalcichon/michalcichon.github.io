A few months ago, I bought a computer. In theory, it was supposed to be our “home computer” — something we could use until my wife gets a new laptop from her work. It also ran Windows, so we could use applications that don’t run on my Mac — for example, some scientific programs my wife normally uses at work — and, potentially, a few games. In practice, however, the computer just ended up collecting dust at the bottom of my drawer.

I don’t like wasting resources — whether it’s running water, our valuable time, or a powerful GPU sitting idle, waiting for a task. It’s always a bit painful to see. This makes me reflect on how we use our computers and what it actually means to use their resources wisely.

## How about digging up a few coins while taking a break from gaming?

This was my first idea — why not just play some games? After all, this computer was literally built for gaming. So I tried a few newer titles that need a strong GPU, and it was fun — but honestly, I’m more into retro games. And, you know, to play *Heroes of Might and Magic III* or *The Secret of Monkey Island*, you really don’t need the latest NVIDIA hardware.

You might ask, then, why did I buy something I don’t really need? That’s a fair question. I think we were just worried that a weaker computer wouldn’t be able to handle more complex scientific computations if my wife suddenly needed it.

I think that, in some way, having such a computer forced me to think about using resources more wisely. Don’t get me wrong — I don’t mean that playing games is wrong. In fact, I believe it can be quite valuable to spend time with friends playing, or simply to relax after work. Why not? “Everything is for people” as my mum used to say. I guess I’ve just always preferred to create some kind of measurable value out of the tools I have. That's why I started mining crypto.

This is what tiggers like best: creating abstract representations of value out of bare metal, with GPUs glowing red-hot. I can almost smell the dust coming from the fans spinning wildly. Or is it really?

## Ugly side of computing power

Every kind of power comes with a price — and I don’t just mean electricity bills or hardware costs. Computers, like any other tools, can be used only for a limited time. Just like other resources such as time or money, they can be spent for a specific purpose — and they are not limitless. When I spend five bucks on a chocolate bar, I can’t spend the same money again on charity. Similarly, when my GPU is busy mining another altcoin, it can’t render game graphics or perform any other, more or less valuable, work.

The story of Beverly Morris[^bbc-water] from rural Georgia shows another, far less abstract side of our digital hunger. Her quiet countryside home turned into a place where even drinking water became uncertain — not because of drought or farming, but because of a nearby data centre owned by Meta. Facilities like this one power our online lives and AI tools, but they also consume enormous amounts of water to keep their processors cool. The cloud may sound weightless, yet it has a heavy physical footprint — millions of gallons of water evaporating each day to make sure we can scroll, stream, and chat without interruption. What looks like progress in one window may, quite literally, dry out the world in another.

Operating AI brings similar problems, as it requires a great deal of power. In Boxtown, a predominantly Black neighborhood in Memphis, residents began reporting worsening respiratory problems and foul gas smells after Elon Musk’s xAI facility began operating[^xai-memphis]. Researchers found nitrogen dioxide levels spiking near the site. The community alleges that the data centre and its power turbines are being imposed on them with little transparency or accountability.

Looking back at the birth of the internet — or even the first sparks of ARPANET — it’s hard not to notice a pattern: the more power we crave, the heavier the footprint we leave behind. At some point, we’ll have to face these consequences, because if we don’t, the next wave of progress might come at a price we can no longer ignore.

## The spark that lights the fire

We can’t fix the world in a single day, but we can start a change within ourselves. Each time we mindlessly scroll through social media, we might pause and ask: how much energy was spent building the algorithmic feed that keeps us watching? Maybe our attention could be invested in something more meaningful. Wherever there’s demand, there will always be supply — and I truly believe that real change begins the moment we choose to stop doing one thing and start doing another.
