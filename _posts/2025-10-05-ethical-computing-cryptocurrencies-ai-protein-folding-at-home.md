A few months ago, I bought a computer. In theory, it was supposed to be our “home computer” — something we could use until my wife gets a new laptop from her work. It also ran Windows, so we could use applications that don’t run on my Mac — for example, some scientific programs my wife normally uses at work — and, potentially, a few games. In practice, however, the computer just ended up collecting dust at the bottom of my drawer.

I don’t like wasting resources — whether it’s running water, our valuable time, or a powerful GPU sitting idle, waiting for a task. It’s always a bit painful to see. This makes me reflect on how we use our computers and what it actually means to use their resources wisely.

## How about digging up a few coins while taking a break from gaming?

This was my first idea — why not just play some games? After all, this computer was literally built for gaming. So I tried a few newer titles that need a strong GPU, and it was fun — but honestly, I’m more into retro games. And, you know, to play *Heroes of Might and Magic III* or *The Secret of Monkey Island*, you really don’t need the latest NVIDIA hardware.

You might ask, then, why did I buy something I don’t really need? That’s a fair question. I think we were just worried that a weaker computer wouldn’t be able to handle more complex scientific computations if my wife suddenly needed it.

I think that, in some way, having such a computer forced me to think about using resources more wisely. Don’t get me wrong — I don’t mean that playing games is wrong. In fact, I believe it can be quite valuable to spend time with friends playing, or simply to relax after work. Why not? “Everything is for people,” as my mum used to say. I guess I’ve just always preferred to create some kind of measurable value out of the tools I have. That's why I started mining crypto.

This is what tiggers like best: creating abstract representations of value out of bare metal, with GPUs glowing red-hot. I can almost smell the dust coming from the fans spinning wildly. Or is it really? I did the math and actually
