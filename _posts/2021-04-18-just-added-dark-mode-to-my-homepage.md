![Dark mode]({{site.url}}/assets/2021-04-18/darkmode.png)

My website is just a simple GitHub Page with a basic blog so I decided to keep it simple and not go with any more sophisticated Dark Mode management. It works with the preferred OS settings. ðŸ™‚

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }

  p {
    color: white;
  }
  
  /* etc, etc... */
}
```
