      <h1>Hey! I'm Michał. 👋</h1>

  <section id="early-years">
      <p>
          My journey with technology started early, writing my first programs on an <strong>Atari 800 XL</strong> and saving BASIC code to cassette tapes. What began as childhood curiosity evolved into a career-long focus on building reliable software systems under real-world constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
          I formalized this path at <strong>AGH University of Science and Technology</strong> in Kraków, studying Applied Computer Science. During this time, I began my professional career as a Full Stack Developer (PHP, JavaScript, HTML) before joining <strong>Comarch</strong> as a Software Engineer focused on Java-based systems.

      <p>
          At Comarch, I transitioned into the mobile ecosystem, teaching myself Objective-C and eventually serving as <strong>iOS Team Lead</strong>. Mobile engineering refined my mindset: performance, stability, and predictable behavior became fundamental pillars of my work.
      </p>
      <p>
          Later, at <strong>Codete</strong>, I worked on large-scale iOS applications, including a geolocation-based social platform serving millions. This scale required a deep focus on:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Performance and crash resilience</li>
          <li>Global data consistency</li>
          <li>System-level architecture over feature-level implementation</li>
      </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="current-focus">
      <p>
          Following Codete’s acquisition by <strong>Exadel</strong>, my role shifted toward architecture and internal platform development. Currently, I focus on <strong>AI-powered, agent-based systems</strong> designed to augment software engineering workflows.

          My approach to AI is governed by reliability and maintainability:

      <dl>
          <dt><strong>Reliable & Controllable</strong></dt>
          <dd>Building systems with clear boundaries rather than full, unchecked autonomy.</dd>
          
          <dt><strong>Human-in-the-loop</strong></dt>
          <dd>Designing AI to support and augment human decision-making.</dd>
          
          <dt><strong>Pragmatic Constraints</strong></dt>
          <dd>Respecting real-world limitations regarding performance, privacy, cost, and user trust.</dd>
