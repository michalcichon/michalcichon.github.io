    <h1>About me</h1>
  </header>
  <p>I've always been interested in software engineering. When I was 10, I wrote my first computer program in Atari BASIC after my cousin showed me that I could do something cool with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family">800XL</a>. It wasn't rocket science—I had only some very basic programming knowledge and not even a single book on the subject. I learned from a few old Atari magazines and code examples I found. Using that limited knowledge, I created a simple history quiz. Looking back now, it's interesting that I saved my work entirely on tape! &#x1F609;</p>
  <p>My first high-quality code was written during my studies at the <a href="http://www.ftj.agh.edu.pl/indexe.html">Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.agh.edu.pl/en/">AGH University of Science and Technology</a>. My main areas of interest were software engineering, machine learning, and computer vision. I was also intrigued by parallel computing, but unfortunately, I didn't explore that field deeply enough to be proud of my work in it. For my thesis, I developed an engine for image categorization, which I implemented using Python and C++.</p>
  <p>During my studies, I worked at <a href="http://www.comarch.com/">Comarch</a>, where I learned state-of-the-art programming techniques, best practices, and gained my first experience with the latest Apple technologies.</p>
  <p>I'm experienced in web technologies like Java, JavaScript (Angular, Node.js), and PHP, and I'm always looking for opportunities to master new technologies and programming languages. Currently, I'm focused on <strong>mobile software development for iOS devices</strong>.
