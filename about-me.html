    <h1>About me</h1>
  </header>
  <p>
      My journey with technology started early. My first steps into programming were on an 
      <strong>Atari 800 XL</strong>, where I spent hours writing BASIC programs and saving them to cassette tapes. 
      What began as childhood curiosity quickly evolved into a lifelong career building software.
  </p>

  <p>
      I formalised my passion at <strong>AGH University of Science and Technology</strong> in Krakow, 
      studying Applied Computer Science. During my studies, I began my professional career as a 
      Full Stack Developer, working part-time with PHP, JavaScript, and HTML. I later joined 
      <strong>Comarch</strong> as a Software Engineer, primarily focusing on Java.
  </p>

  <p>
      While at Comarch, I discovered a deep interest in mobile ecosystems. I taught myself 
      Objective-C and transitioned into the world of iOS development, eventually taking on 
      responsibilities as an <strong>iOS Team Lead</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
      I later joined <strong>Codete</strong> as a Software Engineer, where I focused on 
      high-scale iOS applications. My most significant project was a geolocation-based 
      social app used by millions of users. Working on this scale required a heavy focus on:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Achieving a consistently low crash rate and high optimization.</li>
      <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Implementing extensive A/B testing to drive engagement.</li>
      <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Managing complex geolocation data for a global user base.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
      Following Codete’s acquisition by <strong>Exadel</strong>, I moved into my current role 
      focusing on internal <strong>AI products</strong>. Today, I leverage my background in 
      full-stack and mobile engineering to build the next generation of intelligent software tools.
