    <h1>About me</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Well, I have always been interested in software engineering. When I was 10 I wrote my first computer program in Atari BASIC. It wasn't something very spectacular because I had only some basic knowledge about programming and no even one book about it on my bookshelf but only some magazines about Atari. I used the syntax I learned from the code listenings to create a simple history quiz. It's quite interesting from the today's perspective that I saved my work on a tape. &#x1F609;</p>
  <p>My first code of good quality was written on studies at the <a href="http://www.ftj.agh.edu.pl/indexe.html">Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.agh.edu.pl/en/">AGH University of Science and Technology</a>. My main interests were software engineering, machine learning and computer vision. My thesis was to implement an engine for image categorization.</p>
  <p>During my studies I have been working at <a href="http://www.comarch.com/">Comarch</a>, where I have learned a lot of real programming techniques and had my first experience with Apple technologies.</p>
  <p>I have experience in web technologies such as Java, JavaScript (Angular, NodeJS), PHP and I always look for opportunities to master new technologies and programming languages. Now I am focused on <strong>mobile software development for iOS devices</strong>.
