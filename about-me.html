    <h1>About me</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Well, I have always been interested in software engineering. When I was 10 I wrote my first computer program in Atari BASIC after my cousin showed me that I can do something cool with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family">800XL</a>. It wasn't rocket science as I had only some very basic knowledge about programming and no even one book about it on my bookshelf but only some old magazines about Atari. I used the syntax I have learned from code examples and listening to create a simple history quiz. It's quite interesting however from the today's perspective that I saved my work entirely on a tape. &#x1F609;</p>
  <p>My first good quality code was written on studies at the <a href="http://www.ftj.agh.edu.pl/indexe.html">Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.agh.edu.pl/en/">AGH University of Science and Technology</a>. My main interests were software engineering, machine learning and computer vision. I was also interested in parallel computing but unfortunately I haven't explored that field sufficiently to be proud of it. My thesis was to build an engine for image categorization which I implemented in Python and C++.</p>
  <p>During my studies I have been working at <a href="http://www.comarch.com/">Comarch</a>, where I have learned a lot of real programming techniques, good practices, and had my first experience with the latest Apple technologies.</p>
  <p>I have experience in web technologies such as Java, JavaScript (Angular, Node.js), PHP and I always look for opportunities to master new technologies and programming languages. Now I am focused on <strong>mobile software development for iOS devices</strong>.
