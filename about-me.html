    <h1>About me</h1>
  </header>
  <p>I have always been interested in the software development. When I was 10 I wrote my first computer program in Atari BASIC. It wasn't something very spectacular because I had no book about programming but only some magazines about Atari 800 XL/XE and I used all the syntax I learned from example code listenings to create a simple history quiz. But I saved my work on a type which is quite interesting from the perspective of today. &#x1F609;</p>
  <p>My first quality code was written on studies at the <a href="http://www.ftj.agh.edu.pl/indexe.html">Faculty of Physics and Applied Computer Science</a> in <a href="http://www.agh.edu.pl/en/">AGH University of Science and Technology</a>. My main interests were software engineering, machine learning and computer graphics.</p>
  <p>During my studies I have been working at <a href="http://www.comarch.com/">Comarch</a>, where I have learned a lot of real programming techniques and had my first experience with Apple technologies.</p>
  <p>I have experience in many web technologies like Java, JavaScript (Angular, NodeJS), PHP and I always look for opportunities to master new technologies and programming languages. Now I am focused on mobile software development for iOS devices.
